During my master at **Johns Hopkins University**, apart from my research responsibilities where I contributed to designing a novel pneumatic catheter and engineering a UI-enhanced real-time robot system, I was also entrusted with the role of a **Teaching Assistant** for the graduate course **EN.530.721: Medical Robotics System Design**.

In this unique teaching role, I did not merely follow a standard curriculum. I brought my very own research into the classroom, sharing the intricacies of the pneumatic catheter system I was developing. This direct integration of research into teaching allowed students to grasp real-world applications and challenges of medical robotics.

My responsibilities as a TA included:
- Designing relevant lab experiments.
- Authoring detailed manuals to guide students.
- Holding dedicated office hours for personalized mentorship.
- Assessing student projects and providing constructive feedback.

This experience was transformative, underscoring the significance of hands-on teaching. I believe imparting lessons directly from one's research journey enhances the depth and quality of learning. Being able to guide students, answer their curiosities, and witness their eureka moments, especially on a project I was deeply involved with, was profoundly rewarding.
