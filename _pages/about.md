<!-- 
*Welcome!*
------ -->

I'm Jaspor, a 2024 Ph.D. student at the Reconfigurable Robotics Lab (RRL) at EPFL, Switzerland. My work focuses on designing and building intelligent robots that can change their shape and function, inspired by origami, for tangible reality and human-robot interaction. I'm particularly interested in creating new types of robots that can be used in wearable tech, medical devices, and healthcare robotics.

Before starting my Ph.D., I earned my Master’s degree at the Laboratory for Computational Science and Robotics (LCSR) at Johns Hopkins University. There, I worked on medical robotics and explored how robotics could interact with AR/MR tech as well as soft material. My background in robotics engineering comes from my undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute, where I specialized in advanced design and manufacturing. 

For more information on my research interests and projects, check out my [Research page](https://jasporjiang.github.io/publications/)!

I care about promoting open, collaborative, and reproducible science. In my free time, you will find me traveling around the world, discovering the beauty of nature.
